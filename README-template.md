## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties, flexbox & grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Josh W Comeau's [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)

### What I learned

This experience was mostly a refresher of concepts I'm familiar with, but over the course of the project I learned, the hard way, how difficult it can be to reliably make an app responsive for both desktop and mobile.

I also learned how useful utility classes can be. Writing them early enough with intention for the whole project can make writing HTML/JSX later down the line much quicker.

Something else I discovered was that asset files also need to be imported at the top of the JS file in order to be used in JSX. I'm used to just only routing where the asset is in HTML, and forgot Javascript functions differently.

### Continued development

In the future I definitely want to work on responsive design. This project suffered at the end because I didn't keep it in mind when began, leading to a massive headache trying to implement mobile responsiveness after everything else is already in place.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin's tutorials and tips were a godsend for me and helped me to further understand CSS massively.
